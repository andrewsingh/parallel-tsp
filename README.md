Parallel Algorithms for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (15-418 Final Project)

## Testing an algorithm
To test one of the algorithms, for example Held-Karp, compile the code: `g++ held_karp.cpp`. Then run the resulting executable on one of the TSP instances: `./a.out < ../instances/br17.atsp`. For this instance, the optimal cost is 39.
